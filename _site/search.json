    "text": "Batting averages seem to have changed over time, but not in the direction that you might expect.\nTypical averages have worsened over time, but only for top-order batsmen. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean that batting skill levels have declined, as other factors might also be involved.\nI’ll now explain how I arrived at this conclusion and the assumptions that I made along the way. The starting point, as ever, was data. Specifically, the wonderful data from the espnCricinfo stats engine.\n\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nscrape_stats <- function(value_count){\n  value_url <- paste0(\n    \"https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?batting_positionmax1=\",\n    value_count,\n    \";batting_positionmin1=\",\n    value_count,\n    \";batting_positionval1=batting_position;class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;opposition=2;opposition=3;opposition=4;opposition=5;opposition=6;opposition=7;opposition=8;orderby=runs;qualmin1=20;qualval1=innings;size=200;template=results;type=batting\"\n    )\n  \n  read_html(value_url) |> \n    rvest::html_table() |> \n    _[[3]]\n}\n\ndata_scraped <- map(\n  .x = 1:11, \n  .f = ~scrape_stats(value_count = .x)\n  ) |> \n  list_rbind(names_to = \"order_batting\")\n\nwrite_rds(x = data_scraped, file = \"data_scraped.rds\")\n\nThat said, I only consider:\n\nPlayers with twenty innings or more\nScores for and against the ‘top sides’ (i.e. Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies) at some point\n\nAfter a little more tidying, we get the following data on about 1,000 batsmen.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(magick)\n\ndata_batsmen <- read_rds(\"data_scraped.rds\") |> \n  mutate(\n    Name = word(Player, start = 1L, end = -2L),\n    fullCountry = word(Player, -1),\n    Country = str_sub(fullCountry, 2,-2),\n    Start = as.integer(str_sub(Span, 1, 4)),\n    Decade = 10*trunc(Start/10),\n    Name = str_replace_all(Name, \"'\", \" \") \n    ) |> \n  filter(!(Country %in% c(\"BAN\", \"ZIM\"))) |> \n  select(Name, Country, Decade, \"Average\" = Ave, \"Innings\" = Inns, \"Order\" = order_batting) |> \n  arrange(Order, desc(Average))\n\nglimpse(data_batsmen, width = 90)\n\nRows: 990\nColumns: 6\n$ Name    <chr> \"B Mitchell\", \"JB Hobbs\", \"RB Simpson\", \"L Hutton\", \"V Sehwag\", \"H Sutcl…\n$ Country <chr> \"SA\", \"ENG\", \"AUS\", \"ENG\", \"IND\", \"ENG\", \"ENG\", \"SL\", \"SA\", \"AUS\", \"AUS\"…\n$ Decade  <dbl> 1930, 1900, 1960, 1930, 2000, 1920, 1980, 1990, 1940, 1980, 1990, 1960, …\n$ Average <dbl> 65.04, 58.14, 58.03, 57.74, 55.19, 54.38, 53.84, 52.68, 52.66, 52.00, 50…\n$ Innings <int> 26, 87, 28, 120, 21, 20, 21, 41, 23, 90, 105, 74, 35, 26, 67, 27, 31, 18…\n$ Order   <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, …\n\n\n\nWe can then analyse the data by batting order, using the splendid gganimate.\n\ndata_batsmen |> \n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = Decade,\n      y = Average,\n      color = Country, \n      size = Innings\n      )\n    ) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"First decade of the batsman's career\",\n    y = \"\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\n    'Players who have ever batted at {closest_state} in the order',\n    subtitle = 'Average when batting at that position'\n    ) + \n  transition_states(\n    states = Order,\n    transition_length = 2,\n    state_length = 1\n    ) + \n  ease_aes('cubic-in-out') \n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough that looks cool, I find it hard to detect patterns in animations, and so switch to a static plot.\n\ndata_batsmen |> \n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = Order,\n      y = Average,\n      colour = Decade\n      )\n    ) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11), breaks = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = c(0, 50, 100), breaks = c(0, 50, 100)) +\n  facet_wrap(~Decade) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Data is limited before the 1950s\\n',\n    subtitle = 'Batting average, when batting at that position, for a career that started in the given decade',\n    x = \"\\nBatting order\",\n    y = NULL\n    ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the paucity of data before the 1950s and in this decade, it makes sense to drop these decades from our analysis.

Furthermore, the lines with higher typical top-order averages all seem to be darker (and therefore earlier).\nTo get more specific, let’s split this top-order data into two eras: the 1950s to the 1970s; and the 1980s and beyond. I can then compare the typical top-order batting averages in these eras.\n\ndata_test <- data_batsmen |> \n  filter(\n    between(Decade, 1950, 2010),\n    Order <= 5\n  ) |> \n  mutate(is_1950s_to_1970s = Decade <= 1970) |> \n  select(Average, is_1950s_to_1970s) \n\nt.test(\n  data = data_test, \n  Average ~ is_1950s_to_1970s, \n  alternative = \"less\"\n  )\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  Average by is_1950s_to_1970s\nt = -2.0788, df = 348.5, p-value = 0.01918\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group FALSE and group TRUE is less than 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n       -Inf -0.4100609\nsample estimates:\nmean in group FALSE  mean in group TRUE \n           39.55741            41.54190 \n\n\n\nOK, so that’s a lot of detail! But what does it show?\nEssentially, it says that the reduction in typical top-order batting averages since the 1950s to 1980s is statistically significant. (That is, beyond what we would usually expect from chance alone.)\nOf course, this reduction might not be solely due to lower inherent skill levels relative to the prevailing bowlers. Two possible reasons are that:\n\nThe game is now different to before, with DRS, helmets and masses of analysis\nSurvivor bias might be a factor. After all, we are only considering players with twenty or more innings, for and against the ‘top sides’; a point also complicated by the fact that there are now more test matches per year than in the past\n\nAs is often the way with cricket, so much is in the interpretation and debate. And that’s just another reason to love it!\n\n\n\n[Updated on March 25, 2023]"
